# steam_game_list

~~This is going to be a webscraping type script that I plan to use to pull down a list of games in my steam library~~
~~Once I've got that list I want to look through and get the games rating from either the steam store or another game review website~~

**Turns out with the new library layout on Steam to can create smart filters to sort by rating so I've decieded to archive this**

Check out the details on this new library if you're interested
